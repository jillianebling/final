            <p>The Wellesley Island State Park provides a few options for lodging during your stay - cabins, cottages, or campsites. Each of these accommodations is located in its own section of the island and has its own unique name (Ex. Chipmunk Cabins). Cabins and Cottages require security deposits, and renters are fined for smoking indoors. No more than two cars are allowed at any lodging.</p>

            <h3>Campsites</h3>
            <p> Campsites are the basic camping experience. Renters are provided with a campsite of their choosing. This site will include a fire pit (with a cooking grate), a large bench, and an in-ground faucet nearby. Each “loop” in the park has its own community toilet and shower within walking distance. Campers will find themselves within close but comfortable proximity of neighbors during the peak seasons. These campsites can be rented for $18 per night on average.</p>

            <h3>Cabins</h3>

            <p>Cabins are the middle ground between cottages and campsites. Renters are given two keys to a cabin. The surrounding facilities are the same as a campsite - firepit, inground faucet, and community bathroom nearby. Inside, the cabin includes a table with four chairs, a microwave, a fridge, two bunkbeds, cupboards, and a small closet. These cabins provide enough room for about 4 people and are very comfortable. Cabins can be rented for about $80.50/night.</p>

            <h3>Cottages</h3>
            <p>Cottages are the ultimate comfortable stay at Wellesley Island. Cottages do come with a firepit but lack the community bathroom and in-ground faucet. This is because renters are provided with an in-house bathroom and sink. Cottages are fully furnished, stocked with cooking utensils and a large, comfortable living room. There are two bedrooms per cottage. The master bedroom has one king-sized bed and a dresser, whereas the second bedroom has two twin-sized beds and a dresser. Cottages also provide a covered porch, so guests can sit back and enjoy the view of Eel Bay without worrying about bugs. Kiddos will be happy to hear that there is a large, modern playground near the cottage area. Unlike the other two lodging options, cottages do not allow pets whatsoever. Guests who are found with a pet are fined according to the park’s website. Cottages can be rented for about $155 per night.</p>
