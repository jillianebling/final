        <h3>Content Reflection</h3>
        <p>I believe that I followed CRAP principles appropriately. I kept my content organization and navigation system consistent. I found a color scheme that fits the page. I originally wanted to do something vibrant and use stark whites, but I settled on something more calm. I thought the navy blue and beige colors could be reminiscent of a beach. I included a large graphic of scenery that was relevant to the page content on the top of each webpage. I was planning on doing this for the Park Attraction and Tourist Attraction pages, but I thought it would be confusing to users that some pages did have the graphic and some did not. </p>
        <p>I wanted to keep the content interesting, even with more dull pages such as restaurants. I was careful to divide the content up so that users could find what they were looking for quickly. Most of the time when I use a tourism website and there is a section about “our story” or “about” I skim right past it, so I did not want to make my users sort through the fluff to get to the information they need. I am fortunate to have remembered a lot of the backstory for the two castles, and it ended up being a large part of my focus. I created a Word document similar to what we used for the content section of the group project and created my content there. It ended up being over 3k words, and this boosted my confidence a lot when I started coding. Searching for good images to use was hard, a lot of photos out there are very small and pixelated, or ugly. I was struggling to find a good image for the homepage, so I went back into my photos and found a panorama I had taken on my phone in the 1k Islands and used that.</p>
        <p>Overall, I think this project went well. There were some road bumps with the dropdown boxes in the navigation section and resizing but I worked them out. Next time, I am going to comment on my HTML code as I am working on it because I ended up spending a lot of time going back and organizing it.</p>
