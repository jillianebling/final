            <p>Wellesley Island provides a wide range of amenities depending on where you are camping.</p>

            <h3>Indoor Bathrooms</h3>
            <p>Indoor community shower and restroom facilities are within walking distance of every campsite and cabin. These facilities are clean and easily accessible. Each community restroom includes a men's and women’s toilet, and a separate shower area. There is only one shower for each gender, so it can be tedious waiting to shower some mornings. Hot water is always available. Visitors are expected to bring their own shower products.</p>

            <h3>Water Faucets</h3>
            <p>Inground water faucets are available within walking distance of each cabin and campsite. They are pump faucets and have excellent water pressure. These faucets are great for dishwashing water, and putting campfires out.</p>

            <h3>Stores</h3>
            <p>There is a general store on the Island, it is located between the marina and the beach. It is open all day until about 9 p.m. The store sells a variety of beach toys and accessories such as goggles and floaties. They sell basic camping supplies and food and beverages as well. Guests may also purchase soft-serve ice cream and coffee at any point during the day. Right outside of the park visitors will be able to find Woody’s. Woody’s is not affiliated with the state park but sells firewood, sparklers, bait and tackle, etc. Woody himself is always manning the counter with his gentle black lab.</p>

            <h3>Climate Control</h3>
            <p>Heat and cooling are generally not available within the parks. Of course, cottages come with a wood stove heater, but outside of that visitors are expected to bring fans or small heaters to keep them warm. Of course, campfires are always allowed as long as they are inside of the firepits provided.</p>
