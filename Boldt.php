            <h3>How To Get To Heart Island</h3>
            <p>Boldt Castle resides on Heart Island and is only accessible by water. Uncle Sam Boat Tours provides a short shuttle service to Heart Island (~10 mins). Visitors may also provide their own transportation, and leave their boats on the far side of the island, provided that there is room. Either way, the short jog to Heart Island is beautiful and allows visitors to get up close to buildings such as the powerhouse and children’s play house that reside on the outskirts of the Island.</p>

            <h3>The Story of Boldt Castle</h3>
            <img class="FBoldt" src="assets/media/images/boldtfamily1.jpg" alt="Boldt Family">
            <p>Heart Island is the origin of a tragic love story. George Boldt was a very wealthy man and owner of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Mr. Boldt and his wife Louise spent considerable time at the Waldorf Astoria, but George wanted to build something that Louise could call her own. Mr. Boldt bought “Hart Island” in the St. Lawrence River and got to work. Boldt started by renaming the island “Heart Island”, and carved out the shoreline to reflect the shape of a heart. Then, he spent years constructing a massive castle for Louise to enjoy all in secret. Boldt planned to give Louise the castle on Valentine’s Day, but tragically Louise passed away the day before. All construction was ceased on the island, and George Boldt never stepped foot on it again for as long as he lived. The island fell into disrepair until the Thousand Island Bridge Authority bought it. The TIBA is restoring it up to the point where George Boldt stopped construction.</p>

            <p>Boldt Castle is full of stunning and fully furnished rooms. The whole castle is decorated with period-appropriate pieces. Visitors can even tour the basement which includes a pool-turned wishing-well. The TIBA has set up a gift shop inside the castle.

The Children’s playhouse and powerhouse are also open to the public. Right across the river lies the Yacht House.
