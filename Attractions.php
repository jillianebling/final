            <h3>The Butterfly House</h3>
            <p>The butterfly house is located on the side of the North Field loop. It is a short walk away from the parking lot. To access the garden, visitors must refer to the park activities schedule and find a tour guide up into the house. This is the only way to access it because it remains locked by park rangers so as to keep the butterflies safe. </p>

            <h3>Nature Center and Museum</h3>
            <p>The nature center is a relatively new part of the park. This is where many activities are held, like children’s painting activities or workshops where visitors are given the opportunity to learn about nature. Either way, the nature center is open daily, and visitors are welcome to walk in and look at the various exhibits they have. The museum is a short walk away from the nature center. The museum is open most days until about 5 p.m. It is free to enter, and visitors can expect to see beautiful taxidermy displays of much of the wildlife that is on the island. The staff is amiable, and always open to questions about the museum.</p>

            <h3>Arcade</h3>
            <p>The arcade can be found right next to the Wellesley Island general store. It is right in the middle of the beach and marina. The arcade is a very new addition to the state park. Visitors use quarters to play the various games in the arcade. These games are classic fun. Arcade basketball, fighting games like Mortal Kombat, Guitar Hero, air hockey, and even a jukebox are all located in the arcade.</p>

            <h3>Beaches</h3>
            <p>There are many natural beaches in the park, but only one of them has a lifeguard. Lifeguards are on duty from early in the morning until about 5 p.m. The beach is very large and there is plenty of room to swim within the designated area. Pets are not allowed at this beach. In the Eagle camping area, there is a beach that is not guarded, and campers are allowed to swim at their own risk. Visitors often let their dogs swim here as well.</p>

        <div class="marina">
            <h3>Marina</h3>
            <p>The marina is located in between the Chipmunk Cabins and the Eagle camping area. It provides access to the entire St. Lawrence River. There are signs all around the island pointing visitors towards the marina, so it is hard to miss. Visitors can rent a slot in the marina for however many days they wish. Small fishing boats can also be rented for a small fee. Visitors can purchase gas, tackle, and bait within the rental office as well. All watercraft are expected to stay below 5mph within the no-wake zone. A fish cleaning and gutting station is available within the marina’s parking lot and is open to the public.</p>
